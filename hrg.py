"""
pyhrg.hrg — Hierarchical Region Growing for tree crown delineation.

The algorithm in three stages:

1. **Watershed.** Marker-based watershed on the inverted CHM, seeded with
   the tree tops. This yields exactly one region per tree top, so the
   regions *are* the detected trees.
2. **Region adjacency graph.** Neighbouring regions are linked with a
   weighted edge, w(a,b) = alpha*|dmu| + beta*|dsigma| + gamma/(border+1),
   stored as CSR arrays. Per-region count/mean/variance come from the
   same single pixel pass.
3. **Growing and arbitration.** Each tree top grows greedily, absorbing
   neighbouring regions while the combined height variance stays under a
   threshold. Because growing runs independently per seed, two crowns can
   claim the same region; the claims are then arbitrated on the data (see
   :func:`resolve_conflicts`) rather than on write order.

Region statistics are combined in O(1) with the pairwise variance
formula of Chan, Golub & LeVeque, which merges two subsamples of
arbitrary size — as opposed to Welford's update, which adds one sample at
a time and does not apply here.

    retry_rejected : bool
        Whether a candidate rejected once may be reconsidered if it is

        Rejection is not permanent in principle: merging a large,
        homogeneous neighbour can *lower* the region's variance, which
        can bring a previously rejected candidate back under the
        threshold. Blocking rejected candidates (the default) is
        therefore an approximation — it trades that recall for speed and
        keeps each candidate to a single test.

        True searches more thoroughly at the cost of extra merge tests.
        The effect is confined to intermediate variance thresholds, where
        crowns actively merge: on a 1105-tree synthetic scene it changed
        nothing at var_threshold 2 or 8 (rejections are final anyway) and
        nothing at 120 (everything merges regardless), but changed ~17%
        of the raster at 20. The direction is not predictable — the crown
        count moved both up and down — because absorbing more regions
        also shifts which crown wins each contested region.
        Default False.

    Assign each watershed region to exactly one crown.

    Marker-based watershed yields one region per tree top, so the graph
    nodes *are* the detected trees and growing merges neighbouring trees
    into a single crown. This is how the algorithm corrects over-detected
    tree tops, and it means two crowns routinely claim each other's
    regions. Whichever crown loses a mutual claim is absorbed and
    disappears from the output.

    Growing runs independently per seed, so these claims must be
    arbitrated. Doing it by write order (last writer wins) makes the
    result depend on tree-top ordering; this function decides it on the
    data instead:

    - ``'height'``     — the taller tree wins (higher CHM at its seed
      pixel). Dominant trees overtop their neighbours, so ambiguous
      canopy — and any absorbed tree — is attributed to the taller crown.
    - ``'distance'``   — the nearest seed wins (Euclidean distance from
      region centroid to seed pixel, in pixels). Classic ITC behaviour.
    - ``'similarity'`` — the seed whose apex height is closest to the
      region's mean height wins, i.e. a 20 m region joins the 20 m tree
      rather than the 30 m one. In the spirit of the variance criterion
      that drives the growing itself. (Anchoring on the seed rather than
      on the crown's aggregate mean is deliberate: crowns that claim the
      same regions have the same aggregate mean by construction, which
      would leave the rule undefined exactly when it is needed.)

    Ties within a rule are broken by lower crown id, so the output is
    fully reproducible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : dict[int, set[int]]
        seed_id → set of watershed region labels claimed by that seed.
    seed_ids : list[int]
        Seed ids in crown-id order (crown_id = index + 1).
    seed_rc : list[tuple[int, int]]
        Seed pixel (row, col), same order as *seed_ids*.
    seed_height : ndarray[float]
        CHM height at each seed pixel, same order as *seed_ids*.
    reg_mean, reg_cy, reg_cx : ndarray
        Per-region mean height and centroid, indexed by region label.
    rule : {'height', 'distance', 'similarity'}
        Arbitration rule for contested regions.
    protect_seeds : bool
        If True, the region holding a tree top always stays with that
        tree top's crown, so no tree is ever absorbed and every input
        tree top yields a crown. Disables merging.

class HierarchicalRegionGrower:
    """
    Watershed + weighted region adjacency graph + variance-constrained growing.

    Improvements over v1:
      1. Pairwise statistics — O(1) scalar merge instead of array scans
      2. Priority queue — O(log k) candidate selection
      3. Parallel grows — one process per seed (shared read-only graph)
      4. Weighted RAG edges — α·|Δμ| + β·|Δσ| + γ·1/(border+1)
      5. Morphological mask — binary_opening to remove flat background
      6. Variance annealing — schedule-based threshold tightening
      7. Numba @njit — accelerated graph build and stat computation

    Seeds grow independently, so two crowns may claim the same watershed
    region. Contested regions are arbitrated explicitly (see the
    ``conflict_rule`` argument of :meth:`run_all`), which makes the output
    reproducible regardless of seed order.

    This class operates purely on arrays and never touches the disk;
    reading and writing rasters lives in :mod:`pyhrg.io`. Smoothing is not
    applied here either — pass an already-smoothed CHM if you want one
    (see :func:`pyhrg.chm.smooth_chm`).

        Full pipeline: watershed -> weighted RAG -> grows -> arbitration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tree_tops_pixels : list of (row, col)
            Seed pixel coordinates.
        variance_thresh : float
            Maximum allowed variance (σ²) within a grown region.
        mask_thresh : float
            CHM height threshold for initial mask.
        morpho_radius : int
            Disk radius for morphological mask cleaning (0 = off).
        alpha, beta, gamma : float
            RAG edge weight coefficients (see build_adjacency_graph).
        anneal_lambda : float
            Variance threshold annealing factor per iteration.
            1.0 = constant (v1 behavior), <1.0 = tightening.
        max_iters : int

        conflict_rule : {'height', 'distance', 'similarity'}
            How to arbitrate watershed regions claimed by more than one
            crown. Watershed gives one region per tree top, so growing
            merges neighbouring trees and the loser of a mutual claim is
            absorbed — this is how over-detected tree tops get corrected,
            and it means the crown count can end up below the tree-top
            count.

            - ``'height'`` (default) — the taller tree wins.
            - ``'distance'`` — the nearest seed wins.
            - ``'similarity'`` — the seed whose height best matches the
              region's mean height wins.

            Ties are broken by lower crown id, so results are reproducible.
            The number of contested regions is stored in
            ``self.n_contested`` after the run.
        protect_seeds : bool
            If True, no tree is ever absorbed: every input tree top keeps
            its own region and yields its own crown. Use when the tree
            tops are trusted (e.g. field-measured) and merging is not
            wanted. Default False.
        retry_rejected : bool
            Allow a rejected region to be reconsidered if reached again
            from another accepted region. Default False, which is faster
            but is an approximation — see
            :func:`_hierarchical_grow_single`.
        n_jobs : int
            Number of parallel processes. 1 = sequential. -1 = all cores.
            The grow is cheap per seed, so this pays off only for large
            scenes; the context is shared per worker rather than per
            task, but process start-up still costs ~0.1 s each.

        Returns
        -------
        crown_raster : ndarray[int32]
            Crown id per pixel (0 = background), same shape as the CHM.
            Crown ids follow the order of *tree_tops_pixels* (1-based);
            absorbed trees leave no pixels, so ids can be missing.
