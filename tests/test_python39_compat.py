"""The package claims requires-python >= 3.9. Check that it means it.

pyHRG 0.5.0 shipped ``max_iters: int | None`` and did not import at all on
3.9: PEP 604 in an annotation is a runtime expression before 3.10. It was
invisible here because development runs on 3.12, and CI caught it only after
the tag. These tests reproduce the two ways a file can be 3.9-illegal while
parsing fine on a modern interpreter.
