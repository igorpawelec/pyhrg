"""User-facing messages must encode on the console they print to.

pyHRG runs on Polish Windows, where the default console encoding is
cp1250, not UTF-8. A string sent to ``print``, ``sys.std*.write``,
``warnings.warn``, ``logging`` or ``raise`` is encoded with that codec on
the way out; a character it cannot represent -- ``->`` written as U+2192,
``x`` as U+00D7, ``>=`` as U+2265 -- raises UnicodeEncodeError at the moment
of printing. Because the CLI catches ValueError (which UnicodeEncodeError
subclasses) and prints ``str(e)``, the crash was even reclassified as a
"user error" with a cryptic charmap message.

This is a static check over the source rather than a run, so it covers every
message, not only the ones some other test happens to exercise. It flags a
string literal only when it is an argument to one of those sinks or the
argument of a ``raise`` -- non-ASCII in docstrings and comments never reaches
the console and is fine.

The audit that added this found the bug in three of the four sink kinds
across the family: the block that reads pyhrg.__init__ shows the same style
elsewhere, so it is worth keeping the whole package honest.
