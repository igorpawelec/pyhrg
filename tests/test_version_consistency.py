"""The version must be one number, not four that agree by hand.

GeoPalette shipped 0.5.0 and 0.6.0 with ``__version__`` still reading 0.4.0,
and rHRG's CITATION.cff sat two releases behind DESCRIPTION. Both times the
bump edited the places someone remembered instead of searching for the old
number, and nothing was checking. pyHRG's four declarations agree today;
this is what keeps them agreeing.

What this compares needs care. ``pyhrg.__version__`` is read from the
installed distribution's metadata, with a string literal as the fallback::

    try:
        __version__ = _version("pyhrg")
    except Exception:
        __version__ = "0.5.1"

So the *runtime* value describes the environment, not this checkout. That is
not hypothetical here: an install in the conda env reported 0.1.0 against a
source tree at 0.5.0, which is correct behaviour and would make a runtime
comparison fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the release. The
literal is the part that goes stale silently, and it is what anyone running
from an unbuilt checkout sees, so the literal is what is checked here.
